	<p>Here is some beginner friendly explanation:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><b>Hosting</b></dt>
		<dd>Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.</dd>
		<dt><b>Designing</b></dt>
		<dd>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development.</dd>
		<dt><b>Fullstack Service</b></dt>
		<dd>Develop both client and server software. Such as entirety of browser (yes, front-end and back-end included!), server, and database.</dd>
		<dt><b>Front End</b></dt>
		<dd>The front-end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.</dd>
		<dt><b>Back End</b></dt>
		<dd>So what makes the front-end of a website possible? Where is all that data stored? This is where the back-end comes in. The back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database.</dd>
